slstatus - suckless status
==========================
slstatus is a small tool for providing system status information to other
programs over the EWMH property of the root window (used by dwm(1)) or
standard input/output. It is designed to be as efficient as possible by
only issuing the minimum of system calls required.


Features
--------

Project Status
--------------
This is a custom build of slstatus, maintained as a submodule in my dotfiles. Custom patches and configuration are included. For updates, pull the latest changes from the main repo and submodules.

Usage
-----
See the main README for setup instructions. Build and install as above. Configuration is in `config.h`.


Requirements
------------
Currently slstatus works on FreeBSD, Linux and OpenBSD.
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.

- For volume percentage on Linux the kernel module `snd-mixer-oss` must be
  loaded.
- For volume percentage on FreeBSD, `sndio` must be installed.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
